<p>The quality or virtue of patience is presented as either forbearance or endurance. In the former sense it is a quality of self-restraint or of not giving way to anger, even in the face of provocation; it is attributed to both God and man and is closely related to mercy and compassion. In the latter sense it is a virtue by which one bears the trials of this life with resignation to God's will, and is therefore associated with hope. obviously in this sense it is predicated only of man. This article discusses patience as forbearance, patience as endurance, and continues with a discussion on the eschatological aspect of patience.</p>
